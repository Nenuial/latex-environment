## LaTeX Environments

::: {.center}
The contents of this div will be output in a `center`
LaTeX environment, but will appear in HTML (and any other output 
format as a simple div with the class `center`)
:::


## LaTeX Commands

Will replace spans of class `ce` with the `\ce{}` command for LaTeX output, but leave the spans intact for HTML output. So `[H2SO4]{.ce}` becomes [H2SO4]{.ce}.
